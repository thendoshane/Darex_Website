# Darex Website (2022 Learning Project)

    ⚠️ Status: Archived / Work in Progress This repository is archived. It represents an early learning project from 2022 and is not a finished product.

## Overview

- This repository contains the source code for Darex, a front-end web development practice project I created in 2022. The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of HTML and web design by attempting to replicate a high-quality interface design.

- The design was inspired by an interface concept by instagram.com/christvizcarra.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 📝 Project History & Purpose

I started this project to practice:

-    Structuring web pages using semantic HTML.
-    Implementing design concepts from a visual reference.
-    managing basic asset directories (images).

As this was a learning exercise, development was halted once the core learning objectives were met. The site remains in an unfinished state to be completed.
